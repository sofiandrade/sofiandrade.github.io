Sofia Andrade is a journalist and student at Harvard University, where she is pursuing a joint concentration in History & Literature and Art, Film, & Visual Studies. As a journalist, she has covered a broad range of topics — from anti-Blackness in Miami's Latinx communities to hypermasculinity in young Republicans, and from sexual assault in the indie music scene to the complexities of Cuban American political identity. 

Most recently, she worked as a reporter with WhoWhatWhy, where she covered Florida politics and election integrity leading up to the 2020 election. She also serves as a staff writer in multiple publications, including the Harvard Crimson, the Harvard Political Review, and Pure Nowhere Magazine.
